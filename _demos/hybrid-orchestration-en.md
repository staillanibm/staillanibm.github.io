## Key demonstration points

- **Seamless connectivity** between on-premise and cloud environments
- **Centralized orchestration** of complex business processes
- **Real-time monitoring** of integration flows
- **Unified governance** across the entire hybrid infrastructure

This approach allows enterprises to leverage the best of both worlds: the security and control of on-premise, with the scalability and innovation of the cloud.
